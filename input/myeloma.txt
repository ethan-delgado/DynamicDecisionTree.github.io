Was there a response?
------------------If No, Perform therapy for previously treated myeloma or consider a clinical trial. With refractory disease and lack of treatment options, refer to palliative care.
------------------If Yes, Regardless of transplant or therapy perform follow-up/surveillance by: • Laboratory assessments appropriate for monitoring treatment toxicities may include: CBC, differential, platelet count, blood glucose and electrolytes, and metabolic panel. • Serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE. • 24-h urine for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE at baseline and as needed or if there is a significant change in FLC levels. • Serum FLC assay. • Whole-body advanced imaging with FDG PET/CT, low-dose CT scan, MRI without contrast as needed, ideally with the same technique used at diagnosis. • Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with multi-parameter flow cytometry as needed. • Consider MRD as indicated for prognostication aftershared decision with patient. Afterwards, is treatment needed for post-transplant or for relapsed/progressive diseases after continuous/maintenance myeloma therapy without prior transplant?
--------------------If For Relapsed/progressive diseases without prior transplant, after continuous/maintenance myeloma therapy, Perform therapy for previously treated myeloma or consider a clinical trial. With refractory disease and lack of treatment options, refer to palliative care. 
--------------------If For post-transplant, Is it for a Post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (single or tandem) or Post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant?
----------------------If Post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (single or tandem), is it a Progressive disease or a Response/Stable disease?
------------------------If Progressive disease, Perform additional treatment by therapy for previously treated myeloma, or through clinical trial or through Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.
------------------------If Response/Stable disease, Perform maintenance therapy (category 1) or a clinical trial. Is the disease now progressive?
--------------------------If No, Patient is treated.
--------------------------If Yes, Perform additional treatment by therapy for previously treated myeloma, or through clinical trial +/- additional autologous hematopoietic cell transplant or through Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.
----------------------If Post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, is it a Progressive disease or a Response/Stable disease?
------------------------If Progressive disease, Perform additional treatment by therapy for previously treated myeloma, or through a clinical trial or through Donor lymphocyte infusion.
------------------------If Response/Stable disease, Perform maintenance therapy on clinical trial or observe. Is the disease now progressive?
--------------------------If No, Patient is treated.
--------------------------If Yes, Perform additional treatment by therapy for previously treated myeloma, or through a clinical trial through Donor lymphocyte infusion.
--------If No, Is MGRS lgM MGRS or MGRS with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) features?
----------If lgM MGRS, follow NCCN Guidlines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphomaa. After, use response criteria for WM. Then measure relapse and individualize treatment based on response and toxicity of prior therapy, patient’s performance status, and renal function at the time of relapse.
----------If MGRS with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) features, follow NCCN Guidelines for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. Then, evaluate renal function and bone marrow involvement or radiologic findings. After, measure relapse and individualize treatment based on response and toxicity of prior therapy, patient’s performance status, and renal function at the time of relapse.
----If MGNS, rule out other causes of neuropathy: Diabetes, Cobalamin deficiency, Thyroid dysfunction, Lyme disease, HIV infection, Syphilis, Autoimmune disease, Cryoglobulinemia, Evaluation for light chain amyloidosis, Anti-MAG antibodiesa, Ganglioside antibody panel, Nerve conduction study (NCS)/electromyogram (EMG), Neurology consult, MYD88 L265P allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) testing of bone marrow, Chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast when possible. After are clinical flindings high suspicion or low suspicion?
------If High Suspicion, findings must have or be Sensory predominant, Length dependent, Slow progression (years), Bilateral and symmetrical, Antibodies present, Demyelination by EMG/NCS OR intermediate suspicion (not high or low suspicion) AND affecting activities of daily living (ADLs). After observation should be done and NCCN Guidlines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphomaa should be followed.
------If Low Suspicion, findings must have or be Motor/pain predominant, Non-length dependent, Rapid progression (weeks to months), Unilateral/asymmetrical, Antibodies not present, No Demyelination by EMG/NCS OR intermediate/high suspicion AND not affecting ADLs. After observation should be done and NCCN Guidlines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphomaa should be followed.
